# Introduction

As a Financial Engineer, Computer Scientist, and Quantitative Analyist, I found myself in a dilemma.

I wanted to write algorithms to analyze stock data with statistical, cryptographic, pattern recognition, and other methods. Little did I realize the nasty surprise that awaited me. As it turns out, this usage of market data is highly restricted, and VERY expensive--it can easily cost tens of thousands of USD per month. These are called "non-display fees." [1][2][3]. 

So, what to do? I had to remain in compliance with regulations; however, a data feed was out of my price range. At the same time, I still wanted to develop quantitative algorithms for real-time analysis of tick data.

The only answer was to write a script to generate my own data. There, I faced no restrictions, and could write analytic algorithms to my heart's content.

In addition to avoiding exchange fees and regulations, the speeds that Usain produces are far beyond that of most professional data feeds. On an Intel I7-4790K LGA1150 Core Duo processor, ASUS Z-97 Pro Mobo, I can get tick speeds of about 1.5 nanoseconds. This beats pretty much anything--even those colocated at the exchanges--With the exception of those able to run their scripts directly on exchange hardware. This provides the ability to develop low-latency algorithms without stepping on any toes.

Thus, was born Usain; and here it is for you to enjoy. John 3:16.

# Usage

The script is quite simple to use.
- For usage, just type "usain" or "./usain" if you do not have your path set.

Having struggled for decades to make things work with little or no documentation, I really try to make things as easy as possible.

Here is usage copy, which includes some helpful examples:

# Usain Bolt

Usain Bolt is, at this time, the fastest human in the world.

He set the 100m dash world record on 8/16/2009 with a time of 9.58 seconds.
