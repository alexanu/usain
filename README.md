# usain

Welcome! This program will generate dummy stock ticks at user-specified speeds.

Usain Bolt set the 100m dash world record on 8/16/2009 with a time of 9.58 seconds.

# Introduction

This program was born of frustration.

As a computer scientist and quantitative analyist, I wanted to write programs to analyze stock data with statistical, cryptographic, pattern recognition, and other methods. As it turns out, this usage of data is highly regulated, and VERY expensive--can easily cost tens of thousands of USD per month. These are called "non-display fees." [1][2]. 

So, what to do? I had to remain in compliance with regulations; however, a data feed was far beyond my price range. At the same time, I still wanted to develop quantitative algorithms for real-time analysis of tick data.

The only answer was to write a script to generate my own data. There, I faced no restrictions, and could write analytic algorithms to my heart's content.

# Usage

The script is quite simple to use.
- For usage, just type "usain" or "./usain" if you do not have your path set.

Having struggled for decades to make things work with little or no documentation, I really try to make things as easy as possible.

Here is usage copy, which includes some helpful examples:
